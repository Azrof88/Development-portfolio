1. AI Health Risk Predictor
Features:
Collect user data such as age, weight, height, blood pressure, and family history.
Use ML models to predict health risks (e.g., diabetes, heart disease).
Provide preventive measures and lifestyle tips based on predictions.
Steps to Build:
Data Collection:

Use forms to collect user inputs.
Ensure proper validation for inputs (e.g., numeric ranges, required fields).
Machine Learning Model:

Train a model on health datasets (e.g., PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset or similar).
Use classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
Export the trained model to TensorFlow Lite.
Integration in Android:

Use TensorFlow Lite to load and run predictions on user inputs.
Display the prediction results in a user-friendly way (e.g., graphs, percentages).
Recommendation Engine:

Provide personalized advice like dietary changes, exercise routines, or medical tests based on risk levels.
Store tips in a database and fetch them dynamically.
Extra Features:

Add progress tracking with periodic health check-ins.
Enable notifications for reminders (e.g., daily steps or water intake).
